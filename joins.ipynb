    "# Intro\n",
    "In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine that we’re running a magazine company where users can have different types of subscriptions to different products. Different subscriptions might have many different properties. Each customer would also have lots of associated information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have one table with all of the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `order_id`\n",
    "- `customer_id`\n",
    "- `customer_name`\n",
    "- `customer_address`\n",
    "- `subscription_id`\n",
    "- `subscription_description`\n",
    "- `subscription_monthly_price`\n",
    "- `subscription_length`\n",
    "- `purchase_date`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a lot of this information would be repeated. If the same customer has multiple subscriptions, that customer’s name and address will be reported multiple times. If the same subscription type is ordered by multiple customers, then the subscription price and subscription description will be repeated. This will make our table big and unmanageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead, we can split our data into three tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `orders` would contain just the information necessary to describe what was ordered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `order_id`, `customer_id`, `subscription_id`, `purchase_date`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. `subscriptions` would contain the information to describe each type of subscription:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `subscription_id`, `description`, `price_per_month`, `subscription_length`\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. `customers` would contain the information for each customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `address`\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combining Tables Manually\n",
    "Suppose we have the three tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `orders`\n",
    "- `subscriptions`\n",
    "- `customers`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we just look at the `orders` table, we can’t really tell what’s happened in each order. However, if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s examine the order with an `order_id` of 2. It was purchased by the customer with a `customer_id` of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the customer’s name, we look at the `customers` table and look for the item with a `customer_id` value of 2. We can see that Customer 2’s name is ‘Jane Doe’ and that she lives at ‘456 Park Ave’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this kind of matching is called **joining** two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combining Tables with SQL\n",
    "Combining tables manually is time-consuming. Luckily, SQL gives us an easy sequence for this: it’s called a `JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to combine `orders` and `customers`, we would type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT *\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "JOIN customers\n",
    "  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let’s break down this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want.\n",
    "2. The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, `orders`\n",
    "3. The third line uses `JOIN` to say that we want to combine information from `orders` with `customers`.\n",
    "4. The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match `orders` table’s `customer_id` column with `customers` table’s `customer_id` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax `table_name.column_name` to be sure that our requests for columns are unambiguous. In our example, we use this syntax in the `ON` statement, but we will also use it in the `SELECT` or any other statement where we refer to column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: Instead of selecting all the columns using `*`, if we only wanted to select `orders` table’s `order_id` column and `customers` table’s `customer_name` column, we could use the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT orders.order_id,\n",
    "   customers.customer_name\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "JOIN customers\n",
    "  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;`\n",
    "  \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inner Joins\n",
    "Let’s revisit how we joined `orders` and `customers`. For every possible value of `customer_id` in `orders`, there was a corresponding row of `customers` with the same `customer_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if that wasn’t true?\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine that our `customers` table was out of date, and was missing any information on customer 11. If that customer had an order in `orders`, what would happen when we joined the tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform a simple `JOIN` (often called an *inner join*) our result only includes rows that match our `ON` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this [animation](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sql/multiple-tables/inner-join.gif), which illustrates an inner join of two tables on `table1.c2 = table2.c2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and last rows have matching values of `c2`. The middle rows do not match. The final result has all values from the first and last rows but does not include the non-matching middle row.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Left Joins\n",
    "What if we want to combine two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL lets us do this through a command called `LEFT JOIN`. A *left join* will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this [animation](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sql/multiple-tables/left-join.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and last rows have matching values of `c2`. The middle rows do not match. The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This animation represents a table operation produced by the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT *\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "LEFT JOIN table2\n",
    "  ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;`\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. The first line selects all columns from both tables.\n",
    "2. The second line selects `table1` (the “left” table).\n",
    "3. The third line performs a `LEFT JOIN` on `table2` (the “right” table).\n",
    "4. The fourth line tells SQL how to perform the join (by looking for matching values in column `c2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Primary Key vs Foreign Key\n",
    "Recall the three tables: `orders`, `subscriptions`, and `customers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tables has a column that uniquely identifies each row of that table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `order_id` for `orders`\n",
    "- `subscription_id` for `subscriptions`\n",
    "- `customer_id` for `customers`\n",
    "\n",
    "These special columns are called **primary keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys have a few requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- None of the values can be `NULL`.\n",
    "- Each value must be unique (i.e., you can’t have two customers with the same `customer_id` in the `customers` table).\n",
    "- A table can not have more than one primary key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s reexamine the `orders` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| order_id\t| customer_id\t| subscription_id | \tpurchase_date |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1\t | 2\t| 3 |2017-01-01\n",
    "| 2\t| 2\t| 2\t| 2017-01-01\n",
    "| 3\t| 3\t| 1\t| 2017-01-01\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `customer_id` (the primary key for `customers`) and `subscription_id` (the primary key for `subscriptions`) both appear in this.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the primary key for one table appears in a different table, it is called a **foreign key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So `customer_id` is a primary key when it appears in `customers`, but a foreign key when it appears in `orders`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, our primary keys all had somewhat descriptive names. Generally, the primary key will just be called `id`. Foreign keys will have more descriptive names.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is this important?* The most common types of joins will be joining a foreign key from one table with the primary key from another table. For instance, when we join `orders` and `customers`, we join on `customer_id`, which is a foreign key in `orders` and the primary key in `customers`.\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Cross Join\n",
    "So far, we’ve focused on matching rows that have some information in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we just want to combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we had a table of `shirts` and a table of `pants`, we might want to know all the possible combinations to create different outfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT shirts.shirt_color,\n",
    "   pants.pants_color\n",
    "FROM shirts\n",
    "CROSS JOIN pants;`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first two lines select the columns `shirt_color` and `pants_color`.\n",
    "- The third line pulls data from the table `shirts`.\n",
    "- The fourth line performs a `CROSS JOIN` with `pants`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that cross joins don’t require an `ON` statement. *You’re not really joining on any columns!* \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have 3 different shirts (white, grey, and olive) and 2 different pants (light denim and black), the results might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| shirt_color |\tpants_color |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| white\t| light denim\n",
    "| white\t| black\n",
    "| grey\t| light denim\n",
    "| grey\t| black\n",
    "| olive\t| light denim\n",
    "| olive\t| black\n",
    "\n",
    "3 shirts × 2 pants = 6 combinations!\n",
    "\n",
    "This clothing example is fun, but it’s not very practically useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more common usage of `CROSS JOIN` is when we need to compare each row of a table to a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to our `newspaper` subscriptions. This table contains two columns that we haven’t discussed yet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start_month`: the first month where the customer subscribed to the print newspaper (i.e., `2` for February)\n",
    "- `end_month`: the final month where the customer subscribed to the print newspaper\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to know how many users were subscribed during each month of the year. For each month (`1`, `2`, `3`) we would need to know if a user was subscribed. Follow the steps below to see how we can use a `CROSS JOIN` to solve this problem.\n",

    "1. Eventually, we’ll use a cross join to help us, but first, let’s try a simpler problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let’s start by counting the number of customers who were subscribed to the `newspaper` during March.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of rows and a `WHERE` clause to restrict to two conditions:\n",

    "What happens when we query a database but we really only need a subset of the results returned? How is this situation handled when the subset of data needed spans across multiple tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "One option that may immediately come to mind could be the use of a join. However, we can also use something called a subquery that give us the same functionality as a join, but with much more readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Subqueries\n",
    "As the name suggests, a *subquery* is an **_internal_ query nested inside of an _external_ query**. They can be nested inside of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements. Anytime a subquery is present, it gets executed before the external statement is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subqueries are very similar to joins in terms of functionality; however, joins are more efficient and subqueries are typically more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had two tables listing students in two different clubs, `book_club` and `art_club`, we could find out which students are in both tables by using a join such as:\n",

    "In the same way that the external query selects from the internal query’s results, it is important to note that this same behavior takes place when the external query is an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. Therefore, when a subquery is nested in a `DELETE` statement, the rows to be deleted will be among the results from the *subquery*.\n",
    "\n",

    "Subqueries have the unique ability to take the place of expressions in SQL queries. As such, one way of using subqueries in SQL statements is with comparison operators.\n",
    "\n",
