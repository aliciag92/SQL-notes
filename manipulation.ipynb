    "# Relational Databases\n",
    "What's a relational databases are and how are they organized?\n",
    "\n",
    "` SELECT * FROM celebs`\n",
    "\n",
    "A *relational database* is a database that organizes information into one or more tables. Here, the relational database contains one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *table* is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as *relations*. Here the table is `celebs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *column* is a set of data values of a particular type. Here, `id`, `name`, and `age` are the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *row* is a single record in a table. The first row in the `celebs` table has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An `id` of 1\n",
    "- A `name` of Justin Bieber\n",
    "- An `age` of 22\n",
    "\n",
    "All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `INTEGER`, a positive or negative whole number\n",
    "- `TEXT`, a text string\n",
    "- `DATE`, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD\n",
    "- `REAL`, a decimal value\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Statements\n",
    "The code below is a SQL statement. A statement is text that the database recognizes as a valid command. Statements always end in a semicolon `;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "   column_1 data_type, \n",
    "   column_2 data_type, \n",
    "   column_3 data_type\n",
    ");`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the components of a statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CREATE TABLE` is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.\n",
    "2. `table_name` refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.\n",
    "3. `(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type)` is a parameter. A *parameter* is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of SQL statements vary. The number of lines used does not matter. A statement can be written all on one line, or split up across multiple lines if it makes it easier to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create\n",
    "`CREATE` statements allow us to create a new table in the database. You can use the `CREATE` statement anytime you want to create a new table from scratch. The statement below creates a new table named `celebs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CREATE TABLE celebs (\n",
    "   id INTEGER, \n",
    "   name TEXT, \n",
    "   age INTEGER\n",
    ");`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CREATE TABLE` is a clause that tells SQL you want to create a new table.\n",
    "2. `celebs` is the name of the table.\n",
    "3. `(id INTEGER, name TEXT, age INTEGER)` is a list of parameters defining each column, or attribute in the table and its data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id` is the first column in the table. It stores values of data type `INTEGER`\n",
    "- `name` is the second column in the table. It stores values of data type `TEXT`\n",
    "- `age` is the third column in the table. It stores values of data type `INTEGER`\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert\n",
    "The `INSERT` statement inserts a new row into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `INSERT` statement when you want to add new records. The statement below enters a record for Justin Bieber into the celebs table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) \n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 22);`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `INSERT INTO` is a clause that adds the specified row or rows.\n",
    "- `celebs` is the table the row is added to.\n",
    "- `(id, name, age)` is a parameter identifying the columns that data will be inserted into.\n",
    "- `VALUES` is a clause that indicates the data being inserted.\n",
    "- `(1, 'Justin Bieber', 22)` is a parameter identifying the values being inserted.\n",
    "    - `1`: an integer that will be added to id column\n",
    "    - `'Justin Bieber'`: text that will be added to name column\n",
    "    - `22`: an integer that will be added to age column\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select\n",
    "`SELECT` statements are used to fetch data from a database. In the statement below, `SELECT` returns all data in the name column of the celebs table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT name FROM celebs;`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `SELECT` is a clause that indicates that the statement is a query. You will use `SELECT` every time you query data from a database.\n",
    "2. `name` specifies the column to query data from.\n",
    "3. `FROM celebs` specifies the name of the table to query data from. In this statement, data is queried from the celebs table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also query data from all columns in a table with `SELECT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT * FROM celebs;`\n",
    "\n",
    "`*` is a special wildcard character that allows you to select every column in a table without having to name each one individually. Here, the result set contains every column in the celebs table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT` statements always return a new table called the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alter\n",
    "The `ALTER TABLE` statement adds a new column to a table. You can use this command when you want to add columns to a table. The statement below adds a new column twitter_handle to the celebs table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ALTER TABLE celebs \n",
    "ADD COLUMN twitter_handle TEXT;`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ALTER TABLE` is a clause that lets you make the specified changes.\n",
    "2. `celebs` is the name of the table that is being changed.\n",
    "3. `ADD COLUMN` is a clause that lets you add a new column to a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `twitter_handle` is the name of the new column being added\n",
    "- `TEXT` is the data type for the new column\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `NULL` is a special value in SQL that represents missing or unknown data. Here, the rows that existed before the column was added have `NULL` (∅) values for `twitter_handle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update\n",
    "The `UPDATE` statement edits a row in a table. You can use the `UPDATE` statement when you want to change existing records. The statement below updates the record with an `id` value of `4` to have the `twitter_handle` `@taylorswift13`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPDATE celebs \n",
    "SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13' \n",
    "WHERE id = 4;`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `UPDATE` is a clause that edits a row in the table.\n",
    "2. `celebs` is the name of the table.\n",
    "3. `SET` is a clause that indicates the column to edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `twitter_handle` is the name of the column that is going to be updated\n",
    "- `@taylorswift13` is the new value that is going to be inserted into the `twitter_handle` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `WHERE` is a clause that indicates which row(s) to update with the new column value. Here the row with a `4` in the `id` column is the row that will have the `twitter_handle` updated to `@taylorswift13`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete\n",
    "The `DELETE FROM` statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records. The statement below deletes all records in the `celeb` table with no `twitter_handle`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DELETE FROM celebs \n",
    "WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `DELETE FROM` is a clause that lets you delete rows from a table.\n",
    "2. `celebs` is the name of the table we want to delete rows from.\n",
    "3. `WHERE` is a clause that lets you select which rows you want to delete. Here we want to delete all of the rows where the twitter_handle column `IS NULL`.\n",
    "4. `IS NULL` is a condition in SQL that returns true when the value is `NULL` and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** \n",
    "\n",
    "# Constraints\n",
    "*Constraints* that add information about how a column can be used are invoked after specifying the data type for a column. They can be used to tell the database to reject inserted data that does not adhere to a certain restriction. The statement below sets *constraints* on the `celebs` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CREATE TABLE celebs (\n",
    "   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "   name TEXT UNIQUE,\n",
    "   date_of_birth TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "   date_of_death TEXT DEFAULT 'Not Applicable'\n",
    ");`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `PRIMARY KEY` columns can be used to uniquely identify the row. Attempts to insert a row with an identical value to a row already in the table will result in a *constraint violation* which will not allow you to insert the new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `UNIQUE` columns have a different value for every row. This is similar to `PRIMARY KEY` except a table can have many different `UNIQUE` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `NOT NULL` columns must have a value. Attempts to insert a row without a value for a `NOT NULL` column will result in a constraint violation and the new row will not be inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `DEFAULT` columns take an additional argument that will be the assumed value for an inserted row if the new row does not specify a value for that column.\n",
    "\n",
