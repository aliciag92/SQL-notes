    "\n",
    "#### BBC Country Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Aggregates\n",
    "The functions `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX` and `AVG` are \"aggregates\", each may be applied to a numeric attribute resulting in a single row being returned by the query. (These functions are even more useful when used with the `GROUP BY` clause.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distinct\n",
    "By default the result of a `SELECT` may contain duplicate rows. We can remove these duplicates using the `DISTINCT` key word.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Order by\n",
    "`ORDER BY` permits us to see the result of a `SELECT` in any particular order. We may indicate `ASC` or `DESC` for ascending (smallest first, largest last) or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The total population and GDP of Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `SELECT SUM(population), SUM(gdp)\n",

    "### Using GROUP BY and HAVING\n",
    "#### World Country Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "##### GROUP BY\n",
    "By including a `GROUP BY` clause, functions such as `SUM` and `COUNT` are applied to groups of items sharing values. When you specify `GROUP BY` `continent` the result is that you get only one row for each different value of `continent`. All the other columns must be \"aggregated\" by one of `SUM`, `COUNT` ...\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Having\n",
    "The `HAVING` clause allows use to filter the groups which are displayed. The `WHERE` clause filters rows before the aggregation, the `HAVING` clause filters after the aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an `ORDER BY` clause is included we can refer to columns by their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each continent show the number of countries:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `SELECT continent, COUNT(name)\n",
    "  FROM world\n",
    " GROUP BY continent`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each continent show the total population:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `SELECT continent, SUM(population)\n",
    "  FROM world\n",
    " GROUP BY continent`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `WHERE` and `GROUP BY`. The `WHERE` filter takes place before the aggregating function. For each relevant continent show the number of countries that has a population of at least 200000000.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `SELECT continent, COUNT(name)\n",
    "  FROM world\n",
    " WHERE population>200000000\n",
    " GROUP BY continent`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. The `HAVING` clause is tested after the `GROUP BY`. You can test the aggregated values with a `HAVING` clause. Show the total population of those continents with a total population of at least half a billion.\n",
    "\n",
