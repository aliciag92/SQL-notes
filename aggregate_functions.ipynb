    "# Count\n",
    "The fastest way to calculate *how many* rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`COUNT()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT COUNT(*)\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we want to count every row, so we pass `*` as an argument inside the parenthesis.\n",

    "# Sum\n",
    "SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using `SUM()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SUM()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the total number of downloads for all of the apps combined?\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT SUM(downloads)\n",
    "FROM fake_apps;`\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds all values in the `downloads` column.\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Max / Min\n",
    "The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.\n",

    "The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!\n",
    "\n",
    "`MAX()` takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the downloads column.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MIN()` works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Average\n",
    "SQL uses the `AVG()` function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.\n",

    "\n",
    "`SELECT AVG(downloads)\n",

    "# Group By I\n",
    "Oftentimes, we will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we might want to know the mean IMDb ratings for all movies each year. We could calculate each number by a series of queries with different `WHERE` statements, like so:\n",

    "FROM movies\n",

    "\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there’s a better way!\n",

    "We can use `GROUP BY` to do this in a single step:\n",

    "***\n",
    "# Group By II\n",
    "Sometimes, we want to `GROUP BY` a calculation done on a column.\n",

    "# Having\n",
    "In addition to being able to group data using `GROUP BY`, SQL also allows you to filter which groups to include and which to exclude.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine that we want to see how many movies of different genres were produced each year, but we only care about years and genres with at least 10 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can’t use `WHERE` here because we don’t want to filter the rows; we want to *filter groups*.\n",

    "This is where `HAVING` comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "`HAVING` is very similar to `WHERE`. In fact, all types of `WHERE` clauses can be used with `HAVING`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the following for the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT year,\n",
    "   genre,\n",
    "   COUNT(name)\n",
    "FROM movies\n",
    "GROUP BY 1, 2\n",
